This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of VoxelNet, a deep learning architecture designed for 3D object detection in LiDAR point clouds. Key features include:

	•	Complete implementation of VoxelNet using TensorFlow, designed for processing 3D point cloud data.
	•	Input data handling for point clouds, with voxelization for efficient representation.
	•	The network architecture includes feature extraction, 3D convolution layers, and region proposal network (RPN) for object detection.
	•	Customizable to work with datasets like KITTI and NuScenes, enabling flexible adaptation for different 3D object detection tasks.
	•	Designed for use in autonomous driving, robotics, and other applications requiring accurate object detection from LiDAR data.

This project demonstrates the capabilities of VoxelNet in real-world 3D object detection and is tailored for research and development in autonomous systems.
